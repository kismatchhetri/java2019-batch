# JAVA SWING
Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.
* Java swing components are platform-independent.
* Swing components are lightweight
* Swing supports pluggable look and feel.
* Swing provides more powerful components such as tables, lists, scrollpanes, colorchooser, tabbedpane etc.

# Java Swing Examples
There are two ways to create a frame:

* By creating the object of Frame class (association)
* By extending Frame class (inheritance)
We can write the code of swing inside the main(), constructor or any other method.
